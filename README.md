# `did:me` Method Spec

This repository contains the official specification, JSON-LD context, and related materials for the did:me Decentralized Identifier (DID) method.

did:me is a stable, non-key-derived DID method that uses CID-versioned core snapshots, cryptographic update rules, and optional Data Integrity proofs to support high-trust identity use cases, including compatibility with EU Digital Identity Wallets, OpenID4VCI/VP, and zero-knowledge proof circuits.

The full specification is available at: [spec/v1/spec.md](spec/v1/spec.md)

The associated JSON-LD context is available at: [context/v1/context.jsonld](context/v1/context.jsonld)
